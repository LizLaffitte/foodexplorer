## Welcome to Foodexplorer v1! 

This tool is designed to be a proof-of-concept for manipulating Ruby objects created automagically from the data returned from an API call. Future iterations aim to add features such as custom products, custom cabinets, product lookup, meal logging, and macronutrient ratio calculations for the user.

## Installation

Eventually, **foodexplorer** will be a fully-fledged Ruby gem. At the moment, installation can be performed with the following steps:
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone to your local machine
3. Change directory into \bin
4. Type `ruby start` in your terminal!

## Usage

The primary purpose and usage of this gem was as a way to view the macronutrients of random projects received through an API call to Spoonacular.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
